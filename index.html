  Hey Hey, You're Ak!
</h2>
<h3>
  Hey! Congratulations! Just wanted to tell you how happy and proud I am of you! Congrats on finishing up school, FOREVER!
  I am so happy for you and all your accomplishments! I wish I could ask you to stay a while longer, but I guess its time for you to go for now.
  It's crazy to think that I've known you for these last 2 years. It's been such a joy and blessing to have called you a friend:) I'm really going to miss seeing you around.
  We've been dreading this day for the whole year, but I know that this is just the beginning of a new chapter!
  I am so very very thankful for all the big, little, sad, happy, fun, and loving moments we had together... Sometimes I wonder how we ended up here...

  <font color="indigo">I don't exactly remember the first time we met... but I rememeber one of the first times I met you was at Rice. I had went to the gym and Hana told me to stop by Rice.
  You bought us wings and I probably thought who is this third year scheming on all these girls? LOL but thanks for the first wings over I ever had. </font>
